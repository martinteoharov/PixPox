# PixPox
PixPox is a 2D Modular Game Engine built around the concept of simulating every pixel on screen using simple [Cellular Automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) rules. 

The physics computation is done on the GPU using compute shaders to achieve real time pixel simulation. 
The game engine will feature all kinds of different materials and effects, like:
- fire
- water
- sand
- air
- explosions
- wood, stone, iron
- rust

These materials will be able to interact with each other using cellular automaton rules. For a simple example - water flows and fire spreads, water puts out fire and fire burns wood, etc.

# PixPox - 2D Pixel Game Engine with advanced Cellular Automata Capabilities

PixPox is a 2D pixel game engine designed for game developers who want to create dynamic and engaging games. The engine incorporates advanced cellular automata capabilities, providing developers with a flexible and powerful toolset for creating natural-looking game environments.

## Features
- Entity Component System architecture for scalable and modular game development.
- Advanced cellular automata capabilities.
- Cross-platform compatibility for deployment on multiple devices and platforms.
- Input handling, event messaging, and resource management abstractions for simplified development.
- Lightweight and optimized for performance.

## Getting Started

### Examples
PixPox comes with several example projects to demonstrate the engine's capabilities.

```rust
cargo run --example <example_name>
```

### Contributions
We welcome contributions from developers who are interested in improving the engine. To contribute, simply fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
