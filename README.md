# PixPox
PixPox is a 2D Modular Game Engine built around the concept of simulating every pixel on screen using simple [Cellular Automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) rules. 

The physics computation is done on the GPU using compute shaders to achieve real time pixel simulation. 
The game engine will feature all kinds of different materials and effects, like:
- fire
- water
- sand
- air
- explosions
- wood, stone, iron
- rust

These materials will be able to interact with each other using cellular automaton rules. For a simple example - water flows and fire spreads, water puts out fire and fire burns wood, etc.
